# Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from France who loves back-end. I was a student of Le Wagon Remote (Batch #1090), this was definitely a great experience, I met people from everywhere, new friends, and I learned so many new things in just 9 weeks. Now I just want to keep learning!
I really like Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I also like JavaScript and Stimulus.
