# Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from France who loves back-end. I was a student of `Le Wagon` (Web Development, Remote, Batch #1090), this was definitely a great experience, I met people from everywhere, new friends, and I learned so many new things in just 9 weeks.
I'm now working as a backend (C# and NodeJS) developer at Alten in Lille.
